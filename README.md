# wordsearch
A simple word search game that tracks how many words a player has found and when he/she has won.

# How to use it:
To select a letter, tap on the appropriate tile once.
After selecting some tiles, if you are sure that your selection of letters forms one of the words to be found, double tap the screen.
If it is indeed a word from the list below the grid, you'll be one word closer to victory!

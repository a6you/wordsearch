# Wordsearch Game
A simple word search game that tracks how many words a player has found and when he/she has won.

# Before You Play:
* I used Flutter to create the app, so if you don't have it installed, follow the installation instructions here: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install.
* Based on your preference, use Android Studio or XCode to run the app demo on an emulator from your code editor.

# How to Play:
1. To select a letter, tap on the appropriate tile once.
1. After selecting some tiles, if you are sure that your selection of letters forms one of the words to be found, double tap the screen.
1. If it is indeed a word from the list below the grid, you'll be one word closer to victory!
